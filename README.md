The CommandK CLI is a command line interface for interacting with the CommandK API. It is written in Kotlin and compiled
to a native executable. The CLI is available for Linux, and macOS.

## Download and Install

    ```shell
    $ tar -xvf /path/to/archive.tar.gz -C /path/to/directory
    ```
   
3. Create a symlink to the `cmdk` executable in the `bin` directory of the extracted contents:
